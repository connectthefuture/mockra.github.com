title: Justin.TV Ruby Gem
---

<a href="https://github.com/Mockra/Jtv">Justin.TV Ruby Gem: Jtv</a><br/><p>The Justin.TV gem I created was designed to make it easy for Rails beginners to interact with the Justin.TV API. I&#8217;m looking forward to making improvements to the Gem and hearing feedback from other developers. Please check out the source code and send me a pull request if you&#8217;re interested in the project.</p>
