title: Using Bourbon with Ember-Cli
---
People coming from the Ruby on Rails world are used to the convenience of
having Bourbon. Unfortunately, using Bourbon with a node based stack isn't as
convenient as one would hope due to poor bower support.

Luckily, using Bourbon with Ember Cli is much easier due to the
[ember-cli-bourbon](https://github.com/joefiorini/ember-cli-bourbon) library.
You can install the library by running: `npm install ember-cli-bourbon --save`.
You'll then immediately have access to Bourbon mixins in your sass files.
