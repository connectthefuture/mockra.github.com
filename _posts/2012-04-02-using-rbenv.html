title: Using rbenv
---

<p>Making the switch to rbenv from rvm is pretty simple. Assuming you have homebrew installed, you&#8217;ll want to run the following commands.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
brew install rbenv
brew install ruby-build
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile
</pre>

<p>That will get you started with the core rbenv components. You can now run <code>rbenv install 1.9.3-p125</code> to install the latest version of Ruby. You&#8217;ll then want to run <code>rbenv rehash</code>, as well as <code>rbenv global 1.9.3-p125</code> to set 1.9.3 to your global Ruby version.</p>

<p>To take advantage of rbenv for your applications, you&#8217;ll want to use local versions. First you&#8217;ll need to navigate to the application directory, then run <code>rbenv local your_ruby_version</code> to set the Ruby version for your project.</p>

<p>Bundler is a great tool for replacing RVM gemsets. When initially installing your gems, you should run <code>bundle install --path vendor/bundle</code> to install your gems to a local directory. You&#8217;ll also want to add <code>/vendor/bundle/</code> to your global .gitignore file. I&#8217;d also recommend creating an alias in your .bash_profile, <code>alias binstall='bundle install --path vendor/bundle'

</code></p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, you should be all set with rbenv and bundler.</p>
