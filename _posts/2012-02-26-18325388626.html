title: Adding Byword to Terminal
---

<p>Adding Byword and other applications to the terminal is quick and easy. Just open up your .bash_profile, located in the home directory, with your favorite text editor.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll then need to create an alias for the program you want to add. I&#8217;ve listed Byword as an example below.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint bsh">alias byword='open -a Byword'</pre>

<p>Following my example, you can now open files through the terminal using Byword.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">byword notes.md

</pre>
