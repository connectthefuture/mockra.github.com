VCR is a great tool for testing HTTP requests. VCR records responses
that you can test against in the future. This speeds up tests and allows
you to run them without an internet connection.

I like to create a separate file for setting up VCR configurations, so I
can load it on demand without having to include spec_helper. Here's what
an example vcr_setup file would look like:

    require 'vcr'

    VCR.configure do |c|
      c.cassette_library_dir = 'spec/vcr_cassettes'
      c.hook_into :fakeweb
    end

    RSpec.configure do |c|
      c.extend VCR::RSpec::Macros
    end

Whenever you're interacting with an external service, it's a good idea
to wrap the library, API, or tool that you're using. If something
changes within the tool you're using, you should only need to adapt your
wrapper, not your entire application.
