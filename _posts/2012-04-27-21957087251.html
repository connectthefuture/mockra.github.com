<p>Integrating delayed_job with Capistrano is incredibly simple. The delayed_gem comes with its own recipes, and can be attached to Capistrano with the following commands.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">

# Setup delayed_job

require 'delayed/recipes'



after 'deploy:stop', 'delayed_job:stop'

after 'deploy:start', 'delayed_job:start'

after 'deploy:restart', 'delayed_job:restart'

</pre>
