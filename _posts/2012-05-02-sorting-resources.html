title: Sorting Project Resources
---

<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet of the code I&#8217;ve been using to sort basic resources for my project management application. I&#8217;m planning on tweaking the regular expressions more, but they&#8217;ve been working so far for basic usage tests. The following code is taken from <code>model/resource.rb</code>.

</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">
  before_save :find_format

  def find_format
    self.format = 'string' unless supported_format
  end

  def supported_format
    twitter? || link?
  end

  def twitter?
    self.format = 'twitter' if self.value =~ /\A@[A-Z0-9_]{1,}\Z/i
  end

  def link?
    self.format = 'link' if self.value =~
      /\Ahttp|https|www|(:\/\/){0,1}\.{0,1}[a-z0-9-]{1,}\.{1}[^ ]*\Z/i
  end
</pre>

<p>

As you can see the find_format method is called before a resource is created or updated. The default format is a basic string, which is assigned if the resource value doesn&#8217;t match any of the supported regular expressions.</p>

<p>I currently have support for Twitter and Links; however, I plan to add an RSS format, as well as many others in the future.</p>
