title: Rails Nested Resources
---

<p>Here&#8217;s a quick run down on using nested resources in your Ruby on Rails applications. To get started, you&#8217;ll need to add the resources to your <code>routes.rb</code> file. For this example we&#8217;re going to look at lists and tasks.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">resources :lists do

  resources :tasks

end

</pre>

<p>That will set you up with the following routes and more:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">/lists/:id/tasks

/lists/:id/tasks/new

/lists/:id/tasks/:id

new_list_task_path( @list )

list_task_path( @list, @task )

</pre>

<p>Nested routes are a great way to clean up URLs, as well as provide parameters for your controllers. If we use <code>new_list_task_path( @list )</code>, we can do the following in our controller:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">before_filter :list, on: [ :new ]



def new

  @task = @list.tasks.build

end



def list

  @list = current_user.lists.find_by_id( params[:list_id] )

  redirect_to new_user_url if @list.nil?

end

</pre>

<p>Our new routes are passing the <code>:list_id</code> to our controller, which allows us to authenticate the current_user and build the new task quickly and easily.</p>
