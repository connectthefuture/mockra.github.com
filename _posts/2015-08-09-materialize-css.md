title: Materialize CSS
---
I've used Bootstrap for a lot of my projects, but recently I've been
interested in [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/). It offers a lot
of similar components compared to Bootstrap, but with a cleaner syntax and a
design style based on [Google's Material
Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html).

It's still a work in progress, but definitely something to keep on your radar
if you're looking for an improvement over Bootstrap, or just something
different.

If you're working with EmberJS, there's a great addon called
[ember-cli-materialize](https://github.com/mike-north/ember-cli-materialize)
that provides a lot of the Materialize CSS functionality in components. It's
definitely a large library, but can be useful if you're using a lot of the
Materialize pieces.
