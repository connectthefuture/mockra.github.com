<p>If you&#8217;re currently using the bash shell and looking for some additional features, I&#8217;d highly recommend Zsh. Zsh is a shell that&#8217;s very similar to bash; however, it offers a number of improvements and support for very useful plugins.</p>

<p>If you want to switch to Zsh, the Oh My Zsh framework is a great tool for getting started. You can find the project on <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/">Github</a>. It offers a wide range of plugins and themes that you can use to customize your shell.</p>

<p>Configuration for Zsh is done in the <code>~/.zshrc</code> file. In this file you can customize your theme, as well as plugins that you want to load. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">

# Path to your oh-my-zsh configuration.

ZSH=$HOME/.oh-my-zsh



# Set name of the theme to load.

# Look in ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/

# Optionally, if you set this to "random", it'll load a random theme each

# time that oh-my-zsh is loaded.

ZSH_THEME="wedisagree"



# Example aliases

# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"

# alias ohmyzsh="mate ~/.oh-my-zsh"



# Set to this to use case-sensitive completion

# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"



# Comment this out to disable weekly auto-update checks

# DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE="true"



# Uncomment following line if you want to disable colors in ls

# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"



# Uncomment following line if you want to disable autosetting terminal title.

# DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"



# Uncomment following line if you want red dots to be displayed while waiting for completion

# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"



# Which plugins would you like to load? (plugins can be found in ~/.oh-my-zsh/plugins/*)

# Custom plugins may be added to ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/

# Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)

plugins=(git bundler)



source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh



# Customize to your needs...

export PATH=/Users/mockra/.rbenv/shims:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11/bin



export NODE_PATH=/usr/local/lib/node_modules

eval "$(rbenv init -)"

</pre>

<p>As you can see from my example file, I&#8217;m currently using the wedisagree theme, as well as the git and bundler plugins. You can find a listing of currently available <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Themes">themes</a> and <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/wiki/Plugins">plugins</a> on the Oh My Zsh Wiki.</p>
