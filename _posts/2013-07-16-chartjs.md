I wanted to add a stats page to a website I've been working on, and settled on
using Chart.js. I've been pretty happy with the library, which can be found

Integrating the library with Ruby has been easier than anticipated as well.
Here's a quick example of using the library to display a bar chart.

You can check out the chart in action on
