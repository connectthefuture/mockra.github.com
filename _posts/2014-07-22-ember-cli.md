title: Ember-Cli
---
Getting started with Ember.JS keeps getting easier as the community and toolset
evolve. `ember-cli` is one of the most important tools to come out that makes
developing ember based applications easier. You no longer need to read several
blog posts on application structure, or mess with brunch config files to
compile your code correctly.

Creating a new application is as easy as `npm install -g ember-cli`, and `ember
new your-app-name`. You can then run your ember application with `ember
server`, and even specify a server address using: `ember server --proxy
http://0.0.0.0:3000`.

`ember-cli` also provides commands for building your application, and
generating new controllers, models, etc.. You can view the complete
documentation on the [ember-cli website](http://iamstef.net/ember-cli/).
