title: Testing Rails 3.1 Basic Auth
---

<p>Testing <code>http_basic_authenticate_with</code> is pretty simple. When testing successful tests, you&#8217;ll want to &#8216;login&#8217; first. This can be done with the following code.</p>

<pre class- rb>

request.env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION'] =

  ActionController::HttpAuthentication::Basic

    .encode_credentials( name, password )

</pre>

<p>I&#8217;d recommend adding this to a support method as well.</p>
