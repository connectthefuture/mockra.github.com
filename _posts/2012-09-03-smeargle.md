I just released the first version of my media collection library,
Smeargle. While working on an event management application, I wanted a
library that would collect media from a URL. I also wanted to filter 
images that were too small, so I created Smeargle.

Check out the README on my [Github
page](https://github.com/mockra/smeargle).

The gem is currently hosted on
[rubygems](http://rubygems.org/gems/smeargle).
