<p>I just deployed my project management application to a Linode VPS. It currently supports a basic API, resources, notes, and projects. I plan to add a lot more features in the near future, time permitting. Feel free to check it out <a href="http://tangela.info/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll also be writing a couple of blog posts on Doorkeeper, Capistrano, and Linode, so stay tuned for those.</p>
