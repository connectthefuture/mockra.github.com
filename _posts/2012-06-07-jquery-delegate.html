title: jQuery Delegate
---

<p>If you&#8217;re using AJAX in your views, then you&#8217;re most likely going to want to take advantage of jQuery&#8217;s delegate function. Delegate watches for events in the future, so you no longer need to call sortable, best_in_place, etc. in your AJAX responses.</p>

<p>Getting delegate to work is very straightforward and will require few changes to your existing code. Here are a few examples of how I&#8217;m using delegate in some of my applications.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint cs">
$('span.notes').delegate 'tr.note', 'hover', -&gt;

  $('.best_in_place').best_in_place()

  $('table.notes.sortable tbody').sortable

    axis: 'y'

    handle: '.handle'

    update: -&gt;

      $.post $('table.notes.sortable').attr( 'url' ), 

        $(this).sortable 'serialize'



$('span.notes').delegate 'td.note-completed input.checkbox', 'hover', -&gt;

  project = $('h1.project-title').attr 'id'

  note = $(this).attr 'id'

  $.ajax

    type: 'POST'

    url: $('td.note-completed').attr('url')

    dataType: 'script'

    data: { project_id: project, id: note }
</pre>

<p>My notes table is wrapped in a span with the class of notes. That span isn&#8217;t updated in my AJAX responses, so it&#8217;s a safe wrapper for the delegate method.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using hover for the delegate function, because I find that it provides a much more responsive user experience.</p>

<p>Discovering delegate while reading through the jQuery docs has made my life a lot easier, and I hope it helps someone else as well. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or input, thanks.</p>
