I've been playing around with Clojure for the last couple of days, and built a
small web application that displays a repository's commit messages. It's a
really simple app, but was a lot of fun to make. You can check out the app here:
[github_stories](https://github.com/mockra/github_stories).

The syntax is going to take a while to get used to, but there are a lot of
things I like about the language. One of the best features has to be leiningen,
which is a great tool for managing clojure dependencies. Creating a noir
application was as simple as running:

    lein new noir github-stories

Leiningen will even install clojure for you, just install the script found
[here](http://leiningen.org). I'm looking forward to picking up a book on
clojure in the near future and learning the language. I've heard a lot of good
things about functional languages and the benefits of learning one of them.
