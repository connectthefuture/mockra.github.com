title: Bootstrap and Rails
---

<p>Bootstrap is an incredible tool for quickly deploying your web applications with a clean and usable interface. It&#8217;s also a great fit with Agile Development and Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>There are a lot of options out there for adding Bootstrap to your Rails application, including downloading the CSS files to your vendor/assets directory. You can find the files and Bootstrap documentation here: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</p>

<p>If you want to take advantage of the Mix Ins and Variables that Bootstrap has to offer, then my recommendation is the handy bootstrap-sass gem. You can find that gem on Github here: https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass</p>

<p>Just add the following line to your assets group:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">gem 'bootstrap-sass'</pre>

<p>You can then include the entire Bootstrap CSS framework by adding the following line to one of your SASS files in the assets directory.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint css">@import 'bootstrap'</pre>

<p>If you only want some of the features, you can import a specific group, such as the tables.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">@import 'bootstrap/tables'</pre>
