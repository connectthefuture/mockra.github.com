title: Client Side Frameworks
---
There's been a big push in the web development community towards single page
applications. Frameworks like EmberJS and AngularJS have made it possible to
build maintainable and robust web applications where javascript is a first
class citizen.

One of the most exciting aspects of this movement is the amount of flexibility
it provides developers. When building a standard document based web
application, there's a lot of tooling that developers need to be productive.
This pushed web developers towards large frameworks like Ruby on Rails and
Django.

With the emergence of front-end frameworks, developers no longer need to rely
on the tool chains provided by these major web frameworks. Since we no longer
need our servers to provide complete views, we can move towards simpler
technologies to provide our JSON Apis.

While I would have been hesitant to use Go or Elixir when building a document
based web application, I think they're great solutions for serving JSON to an
EmberJS or AngularJS application.
