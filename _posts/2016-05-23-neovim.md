title: Neovim
---
I recently switched to neovim, and was surprised by how easy the transition
was. You can install neovim on OS X by running:

~~~
  brew install neovim/neovim/neovim
~~~

The first thing I needed to do was link my vimrc to my nvim config. I did
so with the following command:

~~~
  ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
~~~

Neovim should now look and behave pretty similarly to your standard vim setup.
Depending on your setup, there's likely a few changes you'll need to make to
your `.vimrc`. Here's some of the issues I ran into:

I use `vim-test` to run tests while in vim, and needed to update my testing
strategy to work with neovim. This was done easily enough by adding the
following to my `.vimrc`:

~~~
  let test#strategy = "neovim"
~~~

The switch also messed up my system clipboard commands, so I had to switch to
use the system register. I created the following leader commands for yanking
from vim to my system clipboard:

~~~
  map <leader>y "*y<cr>
  nnoremap <leader>yf :let @*=expand("%")<CR>
~~~

The first command will simply yank my current selection to the clipboard. The
second command will add the current filename to the clipboard.

Those are the only changes I've had to make since switching to neovim, and I've
been pretty happy with the results so far. I'll be looking to adapt my current
setup to take more advantage of neovim in the future as well.
