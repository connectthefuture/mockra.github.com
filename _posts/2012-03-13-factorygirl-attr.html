title: FactoryGirl @attr
---

<p>If you&#8217;re tired of having to declare <code>@attr</code> in your tests, then FactoryGirl has you covered. Once you have the <code>gem 'factory_girl_rails'</code> installed, you simply needed to add the following line to your <code>spec_helper.rb.</code></p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">
  config.include Factory::Syntax::Methods
</pre>

<p>You can then setup your tests as such:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">
it 'should create a user' do
  lambda do
    post :create, user: attributes_for( :user )
  end.should change( User, :count ).by 1
end
</pre>
