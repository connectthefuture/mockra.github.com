title: Using Pow
---

<p>Now that I&#8217;ve got a couple of different applications that I work on from time to time, I&#8217;ve found Pow to be a great asset. It&#8217;s a tool for running multiple Rails servers at once on your development machine while eliminating the need for configuring your server ports and starting them up all the time.</p>

<p>Getting the service up and running takes a matter of seconds, and more advanced usage documentation can be found <a href="http://pow.cx/manual">here</a>. To install Pow and set it up for one of your applications, use the following commands.</p>

<pre>

curl get.pow.cx | sh

cd ~/.pow

ln -s /path_to_your_rails_application app_name

</pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example using one of my applications.</p>

<pre>

cd ~/.pow

ln -s ~/Documents/Rails/tangela tangela

</pre>

<p>I would then access my tangela application with this url: <code><a href="http://tangela.dev">http://tangela.dev</a></code>.</p>
