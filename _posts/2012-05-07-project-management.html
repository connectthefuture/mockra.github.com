title: Project Management App - Tangela
---

<p>I&#8217;ve made the Github repository for my project management application public. I have a lot more work to do, particularly when it comes to handling project resources and styling. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the progress I&#8217;ve made though. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have some more free time to work on it when the semester ends. As always, I&#8217;d love some feedback.</p>
