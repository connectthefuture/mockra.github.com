title: Keeping Up In Tech
---
Keeping up with the latest web development news, best practices, and libraries
can be a challenge. While staying up to date with the latest advancements in
the industry can help you improve as a developer, it can also turn into a time
sink.

I've found that the best sources of tech information are weekly newsletters and
podcasts.

Podcasts are a great resource, because they can be consumed away from the
computer. Whether you're at the gym or taking your dog for a walk, you can get
some exercise while diving into a programming topic. I went over some of my
favorite podcasts in a [previous blog
post](http://mockra.com/2014/01/05/podcasts/).

Weekly newsletters are a great replacement for Hacker News, Reddit, and
Twitter. Instead of a constant stream of information, you're able to look at a
small list of curated content, all at once. Here's a list of newsletters I
subscribe to.

* [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/)
* [Javascript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/)
* [The Changelog](http://thechangelog.com/weekly/)
* [Hacker News](http://www.hackernewsletter.com/)

Learning about the latest libraries and best practices can keep you excited
about programming, but it can also be draining. It's good to be efficient when
it comes to getting the latest information, so you can spend more time playing
with the things you're learning about.
