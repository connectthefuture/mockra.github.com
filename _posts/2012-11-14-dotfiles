I just added my dotfiles to a public Github repository. If you're interested in taking a look at them, you can do so [here](https://github.com/mockra/dotfiles). My wedding is in ten days, which I'm incredibly excited for. I should get back to more regular updates once we're done with the wedding, I'll be posting pictures as well.
