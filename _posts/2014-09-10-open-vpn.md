---
If you're looking to setup a personal VPN server, then OpenVPN is a great
option that's easy to setup and use. Here's the few steps required to setup a
VPN server on Ubuntu 12.04.

Download OpenVPN:

`sudo wget http://swupdate.openvpn.org/as/openvpn-as-2.0.7-Ubuntu12.amd_64.deb`

Install OpenVPN:

`dpkg -i openvpn-as-2.0.7-Ubuntu12.amd_64.deb`

Setup your password:

`sudo passwd openvpn`

You can then access your server to grab the client, and connect to your VPN.
Just visit `https://your-server-ip:943` in your browser.
