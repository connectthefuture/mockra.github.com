title: Jtv v0.0.3 Released
---

<a href="http://mockra.github.com/Jtv/">Jtv v0.0.3 Released</a><br/><p>I just updated the Jtv gem to include the search API. <code>JtvSearch.get</code> makes it simple and easy to add a generic stream list to your Ruby application. If I have enough time between school, work, and other side projects, I plan on releasing an example app to demonstrate the gem and caching. Check out the source code, here: <a href="https://github.com/Mockra/Jtv">Jtv Github</a></p>
