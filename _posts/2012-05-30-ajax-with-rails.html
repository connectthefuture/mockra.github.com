title: AJAX with Rails
---

<p>Adding AJAX to a Rails application is pretty easy. There are a couple of simple steps, such as adding <code>remote: true</code> to your form, formatting the response in your controller, and adding an AJAX response file.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an overview of the changes you&#8217;ll need to make to your project.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint haml">
# View

= form_for [ @project, Note.new ], remote: true do |f|

  = f.text_field :content

  = f.submit
</pre>

<p>All we need to do with our views, is add the <code>remote: true</code> option to the form. In this example, I&#8217;m showing AJAX with nested resources.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">
# Controller

def create
    @note = @project.notes.build params[:note]
    @note.user_id = current_user.id

    if @note.save
      respond_to do |format|
        format.html { redirect_to @project }
        format.js { render layout: false }
      end
    else
      render :new
    end
end
</pre>

<p>In the controller we need to add a respond_to block. This will generate the correct response depending on what the client is looking for.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint cs">
# views/notes/create.js.coffee

$('ul.notes').prepend(
  $("&lt;%=escape_javascript( render 'note',
    note: @note, project: @project )%&gt;")
)

$('.new_note')[0].reset()

$('.best_in_place').best_in_place()
</pre>

<p>Here&#8217;s the response that&#8217;s going to load when someone creates a new note in our application. As you can see, we&#8217;re adding the note partial to our notes list. We then reset the note form, and reload best_in_place to work with the newly rendered note.</p>
