title: RMagick External Images
---
RMagick is a great Ruby wrapper for ImageMagick that makes
manipulating images much easier. I've been using it to download external
images and convert them to grayscale.

Here's a sample of how you might accomplish a similar task:

    image = Magick::Image::from_blob open('image_url').read
    image.first.write 'image_save_path'
    image.first.quantize(256, Magick::GRAYColorspace).write 'gray_path'

We're grabbing the image string from the url, then writing that image to
disk using RMagick. We're then converting the image to grayscale and
saving that to a different path. This leaves us with the original image,
as well as a grayscale one.
