title: Twylah and Omniauth Recipes
---

<p>The last few weeks have been pretty crazy, but I&#8217;m having a great time learning the ropes at Twylah. Unfortunately this post will be pretty brief, but I&#8217;m hoping to get back into a normal flow over the weekend.</p>

<p>I just wanted to mention a great gem for interacting with external APIs, Omniauth. The most powerful aspect of Omniauth is recipes. Here&#8217;s a link to a list of strategies available for use with Omniauth: <a href="https://github.com/intridea/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies">Strategy List</a>. You&#8217;ll find recipes for interacting with applications from Twitter to Github.</p>
