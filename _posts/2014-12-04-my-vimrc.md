title: My Vimrc

If you're learning or thinking about learning Vim, one of the most important
pieces is your `.vimrc` file. It's important to being productive and
understanding Vim that you also understand your `.vimrc` file. You want to
make sure that you understand what every line in your `.vimrc` file is doing.

Finding a new command or plugin to add to your `.vimrc` is a great way to
boost your productivity and happiness. There are a variety of tools for
managing Vim plugins, the one I use is
[Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

My favorite plugins for Vim are
[vim-fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and
[ctrlp](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim).

vim-fugitive is a great plugin when you're working in a project that uses git.
It provides you with a variety of commands that provide additional
functionality around git. My favorite command from the plugin is `:GBlame`,
which is a great wrapper around `git blame`. It allows you to view the output
of `git blame` inline with your file. You can then navigate to a specific
line/commit and hit `o`. This will open that commit in a new pane, so you can
view the message, description, and changes.

ctrlp.vim is an essential plugin that provides fuzzy file searching for vim.
It allows you to quickly search for and open files in your project.
