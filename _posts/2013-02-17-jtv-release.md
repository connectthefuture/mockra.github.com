title: Jtv 1.0.0 Release
---
I just released version 1 of my Justin.tv API wrapper. It includes support for
the main endpoints I've been using, and a much cleaner API than the original
release. If you want access to a portion of the API I'm not currently
supporting, please send a feature request.

You can check out the documentation [here](http://mockra.com/Jtv/).
