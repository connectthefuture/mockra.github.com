title: Moved Blog to Github Pages
---
I've decided to move my blog from Tumblr to Github Pages. There are a
lot of tools in place for migrating from various platforms.
Transferring my old posts from Tumblr involved running the following
command.

    ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll/migrators/tumblr"; Jekyll::Tumblr.process("http://www.your_blog_url.com", format="md")'

You'll need to install these dependencies as well.

    gem install json
    pip install html2text

I've been pretty busy getting used to the new commute. I've also picked
up a ticket to GoGaRuCo for September, and I'm really looking forward to
that conference. I'll hopefully get back to writing a blog post every
week soon.
