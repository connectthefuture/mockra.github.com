<p>These last few weeks have been pretty hectic with Diablo 3 and finals, so I haven&#8217;t been programming as much as I&#8217;d like to. I&#8217;m pretty happy with where my project management application is at though. I&#8217;ve included a basic overview with some screenshots <a href="http://mockra.com/portfolio">here</a>. In the next few weeks I hope to make some more progress on my JTV gem, as well as take the time to learn Ember.js.</p>
