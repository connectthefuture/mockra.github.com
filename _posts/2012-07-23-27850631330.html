title: Blocks in IRB
---

<p>I&#8217;ve been using blocks to test a variety of different features in my Rails applications, and one thing that I&#8217;ve found incredibly helpful is adding nil to the end of a block. It&#8217;s a great way to suppress the block content you&#8217;re iterating through. Just add the following to your blocks:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint rb">

@users.each do |user|

  puts user.test_content

end; nil

</pre>
