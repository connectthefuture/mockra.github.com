title: ES6 Arrows
---
ES6 is bringing a wealth of new features to javascript. One of the new features
I'm most excited about is arrow functions. Shorter function declarations are
one of my favorite features from coffeescript, and I'm looking forward to
seeing something similar in javascript.

Unlike in coffeescript, it is necessary to use brackets for multiline
functions, but they can be skipped for shorter functions. Here's a couple
examples below:

```
// Normal
people.map(function(p){ return p.length });

// Arrow
people.map( p => p.length );

// Multiline

var complex = (a, b) => {
  if (a > b) {
    return a;
  } else {
    return b;
  }
}
```
