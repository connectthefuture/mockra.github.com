I just finished reading [Creativity,
Inc.](http://www.amazon.com/Creativity-Inc-Overcoming-Unseen-Inspiration/dp/0812993012), and I must say that I was surprised by how good it was. Ed Catmull fills the book with stories of his experiences at Pixar, and provides valuable lessons applicable to life and programming.

Some of my favorite quotes from the book include:

`Don't wait for things to be perfect before you share them with others. Show
early and show often. It'll be pretty when we get there, but it won't be pretty
along the way.`

`Failure isn't a necessary evil. In fact, it isn't evil at all. It is a
necessary consequence of doing something new.`

`Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than
getting the right idea.`

I'd definitely recommend picking this book up if you're in a creative
profession, or even if you're just in a management position. There's a lot of
great lessons to be learned, and the stories provide for an entertaining read.
