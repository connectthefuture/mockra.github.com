    <h2>David Ratajczak</h2>
    <p>I'm currently working as a web developer at
    <a href="http://mypizza.com/">MyPizza.com</a>. I work with
    Ruby during the day, but at night I'm typically tinkering around with node,
    or whatever language/framework I've recently heard about on one of my
    favorite podcasts. Thanks to the ability to work remotely, I live in
    Lincoln CA, near Sacramento.</p>

    <p>Outside of programming, some of my favorite hobbies are video games,
    hiking, fantasy novels, and food. In particular I enjoy watching
    competitive video game events on
    <a href="http://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch.TV</a>. My favorite fantasy series
    are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malazan_Book_of_the_Fallen">
    Malazan Book of the Fallen</a> and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lies_of_Locke_Lamora".>
    Gentlemen Bastards</a>.</p>
