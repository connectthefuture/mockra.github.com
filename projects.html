          MyPizza.com is a Ruby on Rails application that focuses on serving
          independent and small chain pizza restaurants. The application
          allows your favorite local pizzeria to provide you with a complete
          online ordering experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal for the project has been to provide an easy to use and quick
          way for customers to order their pizza. A large focus has been placed
          to ensure our users can order from any device, and we even see orders
          placed through a variety of gaming consoles.

          The ComboSumo.com API runs on Express and RethinkDB. It's hosted
          through Digital Ocean. The client was built using EmberJS and
          the Materialize CSS framework.
        </p>

        <p>
          The application itself serves as any easy to access resource for
          combos, guides, and other resources specific to the fighting game
          community. The main focus on the website is Street Fighter V content,
          but that will be expanded to more and more games.
