          The ComboSumo.com API runs on Express and RethinkDB. It's hosted
          through Digital Ocean. The client was built using EmberJS and
          the Materialize CSS framework.

        <p>
          The application itself serves as any easy to access resource for
          combos, guides, and other resources specific to the fighting game
          community. The main focus on the website is Street Fighter V content,
          but that will be expanded to more and more games.
